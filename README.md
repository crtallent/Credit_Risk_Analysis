# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

For this project, we are tasked with applying machine learning methods to determine which model is superior when predicting credit card risk. Since the number of low-risk loans issued are much higher than those that are high-risk, the datasets will be imbalanced. This requires us to use a variety of methods and techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes (datasets in which values are heavily slanted). For this project, the imbalanced-learn and skikit-learn libaries were used as they have unbalanced classes in their models. 

The data being evaluated is a [credit card dataset](https://github.com/crtallent/Credit_Risk_Analysis/tree/main/Resources) Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending services company. In order to complete our analyses of the dataset, we used multiple algorithms from the above-mentioned libraries. We then evaluated the performance of each model using
